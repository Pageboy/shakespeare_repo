You will need these resources to work on your InDesign documents.

## What is here?

- book.indt
>This is the template for the first pages of the book. The page size is set to 140mm x 216mm. You can change the margins,
- play.indt
>This is another template to help you set up the play. It includes the style names for the various components of the play.

- cover.indt
> This is the InDesign template that gives you a single landscape document with a back, spine and front. The spine width is based on a book with 200 pages. You can only guess the spine width for the initial design, since the number of pages will be finalised when you have completed the inner pages of the book.

> The cover dimensions are calculated as follows:
- page height = 216mm
- page width = 140mm
- spine = 12mm
- overall cover dimensions 140x2 + 12 = 292mm x 216 mm

> This a sample template generated by Lightning Source. The spine width was calculated with reference to the chosen number of pages and the weight of the paper.
