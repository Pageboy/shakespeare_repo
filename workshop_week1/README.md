#Design and Production
##Week 1 Workshop Instructions

Chris Jennings 2016

###Introduction

This is not a comprehensive explanation of the workshop. Just enough to get you started.

###Getting the files

Go to the GitHub repository and download the ZIP

This ZIP file should be delivered to your Downloads folder and will probably unpack.

Move the folder into a folder within your documents folder.

We will need to work with the following files:

**The images**

The text file called **workshop\_sample.md**

Load this file into TextWrangler. Notice that you can edit this text, but this is not necessary at this stage.

###Converting the markdown file to a Word doc

Click on the script icon &gt; select &gt; BBpandoc-master &gt; Pandoc-docx\

A file will be created in your work folder (where you unpacked the downloaded files). It will be called **workshop\_sample.docx**.

In the following weeks we will convert our text to a more sustainable format (ICML), but for this exercise Microsoft Word is our chosen format.

###Starting InDesign

Open InDesign. You can find the application by selecting the Launchpad on the dock (lower left).

Start a new document with the following settings.

###How do we get these margins?

The idea for this piece is that the grid will be a division of 9 horizontally and vertically. We can use any fields that require numerical input as calculators, so we can use the dimensions of the page divided by 9 or 4.5 to get one or 2 grid units.

###Setting the grid

We set the grid by going to the Preferences pane in InDesign:

###Showing the Grid

We can show the grid by going to **View&gt;Grids & Guides&gt;Show
Document Grid**.

In the following image I have added a tint to the text blocks to help
show how they sit on the page…

###Placing the text

After we have saved this empty InDesign document, we now need to ‘Place’ the Word doc into InDesign. Find *Place* in the file menu. Before you choose the word file, check the box *Show Import Options*.

Here is the dialogue that comes up when you select the
file:

The important settings are:

 - Use **Typographers Quotes**
 - Import Styles Automatically
 After you have hit OK, the text will be loaded onto your cursor. Find
the the top left of the text box and with the SHIFT key down, click to
flow the text into the box.

New pages will appear automatically. Here is what you should see:

**Save!**

###Styles

Time to have a look at the styles palettes. You can see that the paragraph styles used in this example have arrived in InDesign. We need to go through these options during the class. This is the end of this workshop help file; from now on we are going through the options together.

###The next steps

*  Changing paragraph styles
*  Lining numbers
* Font selection
* Alignment
* Spacing
* Leading
* Hyphenation
* Baseline grid
* Adding a character style (for the italics)
* Colour
* Image placement
* Captions

###Following Up

This was just an example of how to start with InDesign. In the next weeks we will be taking the complete introduction text and applying some of these principles but with some more sophisticated aspects including footnotes and a table of contents.
