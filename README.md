# Shakespeare Book assignment for *Design and Production*
## Various Assets provided for creating a Shakespeare book.

<!-- Note: Chris J keeps this locally on his iCloud drive -->

> Before you download the ZIP file, explore these resources by reading the readme files.

## What is here?
You will find the text for 'The Life of Shakespeare' that can be used for the introductory pages of your book. The text is provided in *markdown* but is also converted to *ICML* format for direct placing into InDesign.

The text includes a basic structure, with headings and some inline styles (*italics* and **bold**). There are also some footnotes which will also succesfully be transferred to InDesign.

## Editing the text
This is totally optional. You **do not need to edit** this text for this first part of the assignment. **If you do want** to make changes to the text, you can follow these steps:

 - Download the zip file
 - Locate the file 'Outline-of-his-life.icml'

**Note**: The `ICML` file is provided already so you you do not need to convert the `markdown` file.

## What else is here?
Apart from the text described above, you have also been provided with a selection of images and some InDesign templates. The templates are explained in the Readme file in the resources folder and the images are available for preview in the images folder.

### The Play texts
All available play texts from the public domain are in the *text_of_plays* folder. These are in XML format and the markup will match the styles in the _play.indt_ template for InDesign.

All of the plays have a synopsis provided in the file called `allplaysynopsis.md`.
