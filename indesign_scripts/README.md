# InDesign Scripts

Here are some scripts for InDesign.

## search_change_case.jsx
this will help change the case (from all caps to title case)

## index_topics_list.jsx
this script will take a simple list of words and add them as topics in the open InDesign files. This then, makes it easy to create a simple index.

### How to use?
You need to have completed the introduction section of the book.

Have both the introduction.indd InDesign file and the provided introwordlist.indd file open. Have the latter as the active document (this means it is in the foreground). Run the script.

You will now need to re-open your introduction file and open the index panel (under Window>Type and Tables). You should see the topics listed and you can use the Create Index menu item to build an index to be added to the end of the book.


## How to add the script to InDesign

- You will find the script menu item under Window > Utilities > Scripts
- Now right click over **User**
- See 'Reveal in Finder'
- Now copy the script into the folder called 'Scripts Panel'
