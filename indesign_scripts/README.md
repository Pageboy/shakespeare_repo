#InDesign Scripts

You need the scripts here for InDesign.

## markdownID.jsx
import the introduction text in **Markdown** format.

**Please Note:** The script posted here originates from [Jongware](http://www.jongware.com/markdownid.html). I have modified this script for simplicity in the following way:

- I have changed the constructed styles to have longer names such as header1, header2 etc. (also lowercase).
- I have removed the feature that puts these styles into a styles group call 'Markdown'.

##search_change_case.jsx
this will help change the case (from all caps to title case)

##How to add the script to InDesign

- You will find the script menu item under Window > Utilities > Scripts
- Now right click over **User**
- See 'Reveal in Finder'
- Now copy the script into the folder called 'Scripts Panel'
